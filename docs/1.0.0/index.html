            <H2>Overview</H2>
            <P>
                An application written for the AftGangAglay engine consists of a set of scripts and assets, alongside a
                <A HREF="config.html">configuration file</A> which tells the engine how to properly execute the
                application.
            </P>
            <P>
                The engine runtime itself consists of a single executable which consumes these files and produces the
                desired output (graphics, sound, etc.). The recommended distribution mechanism uses this as the
                user-facing application - i.e. the executable a user would use to launch the application. Further
                packaging information and CLI documentation for the engine executable can be found
                <A HREF="exec.html">here</A>.
            </P>
            <P>
                Applications are scripted using an early version of the Python programming language, and interface with
                the engine through a script API. An index of the functions found in the <EM>native</EM> script API
                (<TT>agan</TT>) is listed <A HREF="api_index.html">here</A>.
