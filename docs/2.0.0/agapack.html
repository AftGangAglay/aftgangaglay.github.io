			<H2>Resource Pack</H2>
			<P>
				AftGangAglay applications are consumed from a single archive which contains all the files required for
				execution. Building this archive is achieved with a build tool integrated into
				"dev builds" of the engine binary, whose use is outlined <A HREF="exec.html">here</A>.
			</P>
			<P>
				The exact specification of the resource pack is not described here, as it is intended to be a
				transparent container and internal details are liable to change between versions without being
				indicated as a breaking change.
