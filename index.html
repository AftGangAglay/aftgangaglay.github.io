                AftGangAglay (or AGA) is a game engine project aiming to build an architecturally modern C codebase
                using technologies which existed at the time of OpenGL 1.0's original specification (June 1992).
            </P>
            <P>
                The engine still aims to provide a capable game-development environment which runs properly and
                efficiently on modern hardware, aswell as catering to modern development sensibilities. Applications
                are architected using an early version of the Python programming language which calls into a native
                script interface which exposes the featureset of the engine.
            </P>

            <P>
                All components of AftGangAglay are available as open source software under
                <A HREF="https://github.com/AftGangAglay">the AftGangAglay Github organisation</A>.
                The main engine <A HREF="https://github.com/AftGangAglay/AftGangAglay">can be found here</A>,
                with build instructions provided in the <TT>INSTALL</TT> file in the root directory.

            <H2>Licence</H2>
            <P>
                AftGangAglay itself is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPLv3 licence. This does <EM>not</EM>
                mean you cannot distribute paid software using the engine - simply that modifications to, and linkage
                against the native AftGangAglay engine need to have their sources made available.

                Typical AftGangAglay applications are themselves the payload executed by the engine, and do not link
                against or modify any GPLv3 licenced code.
