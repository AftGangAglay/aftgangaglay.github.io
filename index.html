            <H2>Overview</H2>
            <P>
                AftGangAglay (or AGA) is a game engine project aiming to build an architecturally modern C codebase
                using technologies which existed at the time of OpenGL 1.0's original specification (June 1992).
            </P>
            <P>
                The engine still aims to provide a capable game-development environment which runs properly and
                efficiently on modern hardware, aswell as catering to modern development sensibilities. Applications
                are architected using an early version of the Python programming language which calls into a native
                script interface which exposes the featureset of the engine.
            </P>
            <H2>Downloads</H2>
            <P>
                All components of AftGangAglay are available as open source software under
                <A HREF="https://github.com/AftGangAglay">the AftGangAglay Github organisation</A>.
                <BR>
                Releases of the main engine repo
                <A HREF="https://github.com/AftGangAglay/AftGangAglay/releases">can be found here</A>,
                with build instructions provided in the <TT>INSTALL</TT> file in the root directory.
                <BR>
                Prebuilt binaries are only provided for x86_64 Windows right now.
            </P>
            <H2>Documentation</H2>
            <P>
                Documentation for the latest release is provided <A HREF="docs/1.0.0/index.html">here</A> along with
                conceptual information and a guide on getting started using AftGangAglay.
                <BR>
                Full archives of this documentation are also provided alongside releases.
            </P>
            <H2>Licence</H2>
            <P>
                AftGangAglay itself is distributed under the terms of the GNU GPLv3 licence. This does <EM>not</EM>
                mean you cannot distribute paid software using the engine - simply that modifications to, and linkage
                against the native AftGangAglay engine need to have their sources made available.

                Typical AftGangAglay applications are themselves the payload executed by the engine, and do not link
                against or modify any GPLv3 licenced code.
            </P>
            <H2>Support</H2>
            <P>
                If you're thinking of support <EM>to</EM> the project - the best way is to just use it; find bugs, open
                issues, send PRs for all the important features I missed.
            </P>
            <P>
                If you're thinking of support <EM>from</EM> the project - I can't offer any formal support avenues at
                the moment, but you can send me an email (<A HREF="mailto:prs.ttg+aga@pm.me">prs.ttg+aga@pm.me</A>) and
                I'll try my best to help if I can.
            </P>
